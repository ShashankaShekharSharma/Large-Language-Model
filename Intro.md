# Large Language Model
- ability to achieve general purpose language generation and understanding
- acquire these abilities by learning statistical relationships from text documents during a computationally intensive self supervised or semi supervised traning process
- they are artificial neural networks, the largest and the most capable ones are built on transformer based architecture
- Some recent implementations are based on other architectures such as recurrent neural networks variants and Mamba
- Can be used for text generation, a form of Generative AI by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or work
  
# Artificial Intelligence
It is a field of Computer Science which enables the computer to do task without beinh explicitly programmed

# Machine Learning
It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence which helps us to perform statisticasl analysis, prediction and forecasting

# Deep Learning
Subset of Mechine Learning which was developed to mimic human brain. It consists of three componenets: Ariticial Neural Netowork, Concurrent Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network

There are two deep learning models
1. Discriminative Models  - Trained on Labelled Datasets
2. Generative Models - Generates new data based on the information that it is being fed

# Natural Language Processing: 
subfield of lingusitic, computer science and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between the computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data

In neuropsychology,  lingustics and philosophy of language a natural language or ordinary language is any language that has evolved natually in humans through use and repetetion without conscious planning and premeditation. Natural language can take different forms such as speech or signing. They are distinguished from constructed and formal languages such as those used to program computers or study logic
