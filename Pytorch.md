# PyTorch
Open source deep learning framework to build AI products. Built by Meta AI research lab and is derived from Lura based torch library. Primarily it is a library for progrmming with tensors (multi dimensional arrays that represents data and parameters in deep neural networks.

It facilitates high level parallel computing on a GPU. A number of pieces of Deep Learning software are built on top of PyTorch including Tesla, Uber's Pyro, HuggingFace's Transformers, PyTorch Lighting and Catalyst.

Used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. Free and open source under modified BSD lisence

## Two high level features of PyTorch
- Tensor computing with strong acceleration via graphics processing units
- Deep Neural networks build on a taped based automatic differentiation system

# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is turning things into numnbers and finding patterns in those numbers

# Tensors
A tensor is generalisation of vectors and matrices and is easily understood as a multidimensional array. It is a term and set of techniques known in machine learning in the training and operation of deep learning models can be described in terms of tensors. In many cases tensors are used as a replacement of Numpy to use the power of GPUs

Tensors are a type of data structure used in linear algebra and like vectors and matrices, you can calculate arithmetic operatios with tensors

`numpy can only handle CPU tensors`
