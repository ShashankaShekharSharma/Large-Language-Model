# PyTorch
Open source deep learning framework to build AI products. Built by Meta AI research lab and is derived from Lura based torch library. Primarily it is a library for progrmming with tensors (multi dimensional arrays that represents data and parameters in deep neural networks.

It facilitates high level parallel computing on a GPU

# Machine Learning
Machine Learning is turning things into numnbers and finding patterns in those numbers
